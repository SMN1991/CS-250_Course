CS-250 Essential Questions 

========================== 

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? 

  Understanding the needs requires the developer to understand the who, the action and why the user wants to do that action. By taking a “Who wants to do What, because Why?” approach, the user story allows for the needs of users to be identified and given context to inform the development of.  

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? 

  Approaching a project requires the developer to understand or establish the objective and goals for the project. Any personal project I have started or considered has always begun with this step. One agile process I want to incorporate is less-up front planning. Starting with the goals and getting into developing sooner is a step that I want to see my work reflect more. I have a tendency in personal project to want to scope out the entire project before any development starts leading to massive feature creep or changes in the goal of the project. I would like my projects to reflect more progress rather than documented plans.  

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? 

  A good team member is responsible, communicative, and approachable. A good team member understands the project and tasks on hand, engages with their fellow developers, and seeks clarification when needs, or helps others as they need. A good team member strives to follow project standards and helps to ensure that every effort improves the project. A good team member holds themselves accountable and accepts criticism with grace and humility. They strive to improve their own skills and helps others improve their own.
